### Tom Brady's Notable Teammates ###
Brady's supporting cast was defined by systemic consistency and a relentless focus on winning. His teammates were often highly talented but also had the unique ability to fit into the Patriots' disciplined system under coach Bill Belichick.

Rob Gronkowski (Tight End): A generational talent and arguably the greatest tight end of all time. He was an unstoppable force in the red zone and a devastating blocker. His dynamic connection with Brady was the cornerstone of the Patriots' second dynasty.

Julian Edelman and Wes Welker (Wide Receivers): These two were known as "slot demons" and became Brady's most reliable security blankets. They were highly productive in the Patriots' system and were crucial in countless third-down conversions and playoff games.

Adam Vinatieri (Kicker): Known as "Mr. Clutch," Vinatieri won three Super Bowls for the Patriots with game-winning kicks, including two as time expired. He was the final piece of the puzzle in the early dynasty's most iconic moments.

Vince Wilfork and Richard Seymour (Defensive Linemen): These two were anchors of the Patriots' defense. Wilfork was an immovable force in the middle, while Seymour was a versatile and dominant pass rusher. They were key to the team's defensive success in the first three Super Bowl victories.

Ty Law (Cornerback): A shutdown corner and Hall of Famer who was the leader of the Patriots' secondary during their early Super Bowl runs. He set the tone for the team's aggressive, ball-hawking defense.

### Eli Manning's Notable Teammates ###
Manning's most notable teammates were defined by their individual brilliance and their ability to rise to the occasion in the playoffs. While his teams lacked the top-to-bottom depth of the Patriots, they had a knack for making huge plays when it mattered most.

Michael Strahan, Osi Umenyiora, and Justin Tuck (Defensive Line): This trio was the engine of the Giants' two Super Bowl runs. They formed a fearsome pass rush that consistently pressured quarterbacks, including Tom Brady, and were instrumental in both Super Bowl victories.

Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks (Wide Receivers): This receiving tandem exploded in the 2011 season, becoming a key reason for the Giants' second Super Bowl run. Both were known for their speed, hands, and ability to make huge plays down the field.

Plaxico Burress (Wide Receiver): The recipient of the game-winning touchdown catch in Super Bowl XLII, Burress was a large, physical receiver who became a crucial part of the Giants' offense during their 2007 season.

David Tyree (Wide Receiver): While not a star for most of his career, Tyree made arguably the most famous play in NFL history—the "Helmet Catch"—which set up the game-winning touchdown in Super Bowl XLII. His one-time moment of brilliance is a testament to the "anything is possible" nature of those Giants teams.

Brandon Jacobs and Ahmad Bradshaw (Running Backs): This bruising running back duo gave the Giants a physical identity on offense. They were instrumental in controlling the clock and running out the game in both Super Bowl victories.

UNYIELDING INSTRUCTIONS
**When deciding, you must**:
1.	Weigh the quarterback's achievements in relation to their coach and star players on offense and defense.  
2.	Take the properties of the QBs and have them play in a parallel universe, Tom Brady plays for the NY Giants under Tom Coughlin and Eli Manning plays under Bill Belichick to see if the greatest QB claim from #1 lives remains the same
3.	If it doesn't factor both scenarios together and make an objective decision
