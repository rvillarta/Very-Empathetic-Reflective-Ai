The NFL is in the midst of its 97th season and each franchise has has its day in the sun. Here is a look at 32 wonderful memories.

The word is open to interpretation. When it comes to defining a moment for each NFL team, we focused on a season, a game, a play or perhaps something even more significant. The point is that when you think of each of these clubs, these are likely the first things that come to mind.

For the most part, you will see your share of NFL championships. But there’s more than meets the eye here, even when it comes to the most successful of franchises. Get ready for a fascinating trip down football’s memory lane

Arizona Cardinals: 2008 postseason (WR Larry Fitzgerald)

There’s not a lot to go on when your franchise has made its share of stops across the county and hasn’t won an NFL championship since 1947. That’s when the team was known as the Chicago Cardinals. Since then, the team has been in St. Louis and has taken up residence in the state of Arizona since 1988.

While the team’s recent highlight package leaves a lot to be desired, it wasn’t that long that this club was making its first and only Super Bowl appearance to date. The season was 2008, the head coach was Ken Whisenhunt and the man pulling the trigger was quarterback Kurt Warner.

There was also a fifth-year wide receiver in Larry Fitzgerald, who turned the playoffs that year into his personal showcase while leading his club to a date with the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII.


Four games added up to a scintillating 30 catches for 546 yards and seven touchdowns. He scored at least one touchdown and totaled at least 100 yards receiving in each contest. Against the Steelers in the Super Bowl, Fitzgerald’s 64-yard score gave Arizona a 23-20 lead with 2:37 to play. Pittsburgh had other plans and the Cardinals’ championship drought continues. But the team’s playoff ride in ’08 was memorable indeed.


Atlanta Falcons: OT win over Vikings in 1998 NFC title game

You could argue that in this day and age of advanced vocabulary, the Atlanta Falcons may have gotten the name of the “Dirty Birds.”

These days, Dan Quinn’s team is celebrating a division championship. On Saturday, they wrapped up the NFC South and are headed to the playoffs for the first time since 2012.

Nearly 20 years ago, the franchise was posting a 14-2 record and on their way to a date with the 15-1 Minnesota Vikings at the Metrodome with a trip to Super Bowl XXXIII on the line. The Purple Gang was unbeaten at home that year and had set a new NFL record by scoring an impressive 556 points in the process.


No doubt that many did not give Dan Reeves’ team a chance in this NFC title tilt. But the Falcons actually jumped out to a 7-0 lead early in the first quarter. But before you knew it, Randall Cunningham and company answered with 20 straight points and the rout appeared to be on. But Minnesota turned over the ball in the final minutes of the second quarter, Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terance Mathis with 56 seconds before intermission and it was game on.

With Atlanta trailing 27-20 late in the fourth quarter, history shows that Vikings kicker Gary Anderson missed his first field goal of the season and gave the Falcons new life. What history rarely mentions is that Reeves’ team still had to drive 71 yards to tie the game. And they did just that in only 1:18, with another Chandler-to-Mathis connection with 49 seconds to go.

In overtime, it was Atlanta’s Morten Andersen that hit a 38-yard field goal that sent the franchise to its first and only Super Bowl appearance. Things would not go well in a 34-19 loss to the Denver Broncos. But just getting there that year by knocking off the explosive Vikings was impressive indeed.

Baltimore Ravens: 2000 Super Bowl championship season

Defense win championships. It’s part of a cliché that certainly rings true. These days in the NFL, it’s getting a little more difficult to stop teams on a consistent basis given the rules and some inconsistent officiating. The latter is a top for another time.

Still, we have seen brief glances of great defense the last decade and change. There were the 2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, as well as the 2013 Seattle Seahawks and ’15 Denver Broncos. All three of those clubs would walk away with a Lombardi Trophy due mainly to their ability to stifle opponents as well as the propensity to force the opposition into costly mistakes.

But what we saw that from the 2000 Baltimore Ravens may never be duplicated in this modern age of football.

Their 20-game season would conclude with a 34-7 trouncing of the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXXV at Raymond James Stadium. Jim Fassel’s team would be limited to 152 total yards and his offense never reached the end zone.

Taking home the Lombardi Trophy would cap off a season-long performance by a defensive unit that held down the fort while the Ravens went five straight games without scoring a touchdown. There would be a late-season quarterback change as Trent Dilfer supplanted Tony Banks and it paid off in a big way.


Here’s the capper. For context, let’s recall that the Seattle Seahawks have given up the fewest points in the league each of the past four seasons. Each year the number was 200-plus. Including the 2000 postseason, the Ravens allowed a total of 17 offensive touchdowns and an astounding 188 points. Four playoff offenses managed only one trip to the end zone.

When you think about that Ravens’ team, you think about Ray Lewis, Tony Siragusa, Peter Boulware, Jamie Sharper, Michael McCrary and Hall of Famer Rod Woodson and more. You also think about a standard that doesn’t figured to be equaled anytime soon.

Buffalo Bills: OT win over Oilers in 1992 AFC Wild Card Game

History has finally decided to be kind to those fabled Buffalo Bills’ teams of the 1990s. The proof is in the pudding being served in Canton, Ohio. Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith, Andre Reed, head coach Marv Levy and general manager Bill Polian are all members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

placeholder
Won or lose, reaching four consecutive Super Bowls isn’t easy regardless of the era. Of course, there will be those who say finding a way to lose four straight Super Bowls isn’t easy ether.

After falling short against the New York Giants (XXV) and Washington Redskins (XXVI) on the final Sundays of the 1990 and ’91 seasons, the Bills were back in the playoffs in 1992. Only this time they were relegated to wild card status. And they would be hosting the Houston Oilers in the wild card round minus starting signal-caller Jim Kelly.

Most know the story by now. Marv Levy’s club would fall behind 35-3 in the third quarter before the atomic wings kicked in. Led by Frank Reich, running back Kenneth Davis and wide receiver Andre Reed, the Bills came all the way back to take a 38-35 lead in the fourth quarter.

Houston quarterback Warren Moon would lead his team to a game-tying field goal and the clubs were headed to overtime. But the Hall of Fame hurler would be picked off in the extra session, setting up Buffalo’s game-winning score. The 41-38 victory featured a 32-point comeback by the Bills, the biggest rally in NFL history.

placeholder
Unfortunately, that year would result in another Super Bowl loss, as would 1993. But no team ever circled the wagons better that afternoon in Orchard Park.

Carolina Panthers: 2015 Super Bowl season

Born in 1995 from expansion, the Carolina Panthers have never put together back-to-back winning seasons. And that won’t be the case again after a disappointing showing in 2016.

It’s been quite the fall from grace for Ron Rivera’s team. Three straight NFC South titles from 2013-15 has morphed into a 6-9 win-loss with one Sunday to go adds up to quite the letdown.

However, we won’t let it take away from quite the campaign of a year ago. When it was all said and done, it culminated in a 24-10 loss to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50.

placeholder
Despite the disappointing conclusion, it was a memorable year for a club just starting its third decade in the league. The Panthers scored an NFL-best 500 points and quarterback Cam Newton was the league’s Most Valuable Player. He threw for 3,837 yards and 35 scores compared to only 10 interceptions. He also ran for 10 touchdowns and his passing prowess improved dramatically after a so-so start.

The defense was spearheaded by standout performances from defensive tackle Kawann Short, linebackers Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis, cornerback Josh Norman and safety Kurt Coleman.

After closing 2014 with four consecutive wins, Carolina made a run at history by opening 14-0. Those 18 straight regular-season victories is one of the longest streaks of success in league’s annals. It all ended at the Georgia Dome in Week 16 in a 20-13 setback to the Atlanta Falcons.

Newton and his teammates would pick up where they left off a week later, rolling the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to cap off a 15-win regular season. The Panthers scored a combined 80 points in their playoff victories over the Seahawks (31-24) and Cardinals (49-15) on their way to a date with the Broncos at Levi’s Stadium.

placeholder
No, Carolina has yet to win an NFL title. But they put on quite a show in 2015.


Chicago Bears: 1985 Super Bowl championship season

With the exception of a Monday night at the Orange Bowl against Dan Marino and the Miami Dolphins, nobody was able to defeat the now-storied 1985 Chicago Bears.

All told, it was an interesting three-season run for Mike Ditka’s team. In 1984, they reached the NFC title game and featured a defense that came up with an NFL-record 72 sacks. Two years later, the ’86 Bears finished 14-2 and at the same time set a new mark for fewest points allowed in a 16-game season (since broken by the 2000 Baltimore Ravens).

But it was the ’85 version of the “Monsters of the Midway” that wound up being crowned Super Bowl champions thanks to one of the most dominating seasons by any club in league annals. Ditka’s club scored 456 points and allowed only 198. That adds up to a plus-258 scoring differential – tied for the eighth-greatest point margin in one season in NFL history.

After defeating 15 of their 16 regular-season opponents, the Bears pitched shutouts in their playoffs wins over the New York Giants (21-0) and Los Angeles Rams (24-0). Chicago made it look easy in Super Bowl XX against the New England Patriots. They allowed a mere seven yards rushing in a 46-10 rout, with Hall of Fame defensive end Richard Dent garnering game MVP honors.

placeholder
To this day, any strong start by the defense of the Chicago Bears is automatically followed by a comparison to this unit from just over 30 years ago. And we almost forget the performance of running back Walter Payton and an offense that ran with power and fed off the defense. One of the true magical teams in NFL history.

Cincinnati Bengals: win over Chargers in 1981 AFC Championship Game

Led by head coach Forrest Gregg, the Cincinnati Bengals sported new uniforms in 1981 and a new direction. The team founded by Paul Brown that began play in the AFL in 1968 would rebound from a 6-10 finish in 1980 and go onto reach Super Bowl XVI at the Pontiac Silverdome.

In order to do so, the team would defeat the Buffalo Bills and San Diego Chargers in the AFC playoffs – both games at since-demolished Riverfront Stadium. It’s the latter contest that remains the most memorable, a 27-7 victory over Don Coryell’s talented Bolts.

placeholder
However, the numbers that remain the most memorable from that afternoon in the Queen City were nine and 59. Make that minus-9 and minus-59. That would be the game time temperature and the wind-chill factor for this tilt.

Led by quarterback Ken Anderson, the Bengals did not seem affected by the cold. Their veteran signal-caller hit on 14 of his 22 pass attempts for 161 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Burly Pete Johnson ran for 80 yards and a score on 21 carries. Cincinnati’s ground attack rolled up 143 yards on 36 attempts.

Meanwhile, the Chargers continually shot themselves in the cleats in the Queen City. Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Fouts threw one touchdown pass but was picked off twice. It was part of four San Diego turnovers in the 20-point setback.

Yes, the Bengals have reached the Super Bowl twice and each time came up short against Joe Montana and those San Francisco 49ers. This gut-check win in adverse conditions is as good as it gets for this always-interesting franchise.

CLEVELAND – DECEMBER 27: Jim Brown

Cleveland Browns: win over Colts in 1964 NFL Championship Game

First things first. These Cleveland Browns won’t become just the second team to finish a season with a 0-16 record. A 20-17 win over the visiting San Diego Chargers on Christmas Eve afternoon snapped the club’s 17-game losing streak that dated back to the final three weeks of ’15.

The modern-day edition of this franchise was born out of expansion in 1999. And unfortunately, things have not gone well in 18 seasons for this ever-changing organization. There have been nine different head coaches, 26 different starting quarterbacks and two winning campaigns. Cleveland’s last playoff appearance came in 2002 and its last season above .500 came back in ’07.

Meanwhile, let’s not forget that when the deal was made for Art Modell’s franchise to make the move to Baltimore, the new team born out of expansion would inherit all of the Browns’ history and records.

Which means that it has been 52 years since the Browns have won an NFL championship. It came two years before the start of the Super Bowl era. Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown was in his next-to-last season in the league. Nevertheless, Cleveland posted a resounding 27-0 victory over the then-Baltimore Colts. Quarterback Frank Ryan served up one interception but threw for 206 yards and three touchdowns – all to wide receiver Gary Collins. Brown added 114 yards on the ground and another 37 yards on three catches.

placeholder
Yes, it’s been a long time since the Browns have been relevant. If the organization ever decides on a head coach and a quarterback, perhaps we won’t have to go back so far for this team’s greatest moment.


Dallas Cowboys: “The Hail Mary”

In 1975, the Dallas Cowboys were not yet “America’s Team.” That would not happen for a couple of years when Bob Ryan of NFL Films lore gave them that nom de guerre.

Before that, they were head coach Tom Landry’s team. And they were also quarterback Roger Staubach’s club. And with a pair of future of Hall of Famers at the controls, the Cowboys were dangerous until the game clocked read 0:00.

In 1974, Dallas finished just 8-6 and missed the postseason – snapping an eight-year streak of getting to the tournament. The club came away with a 10-4 record one year later and earned a wild card berth. Back then, only four teams reached the playoffs in each conference. The Cowboys would be heading north to Minneapolis to face Bud Grant’s Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Divisional Playoffs.

placeholder
It was a game dominated by Landry’s club in terms of the numbers. But late in the fourth quarter, it was Grant’s veterans protecting a 14-10 lead. The Purple Gang was moments away from a third consecutive Super Bowl appearance.

But this was Roger the Dodger. In the ’72 NFC Divisional Playoffs, he rallied the Cowboys from a 28-13 deficit at San Francisco to beat the 49ers, 30-28. In what became known as the “Hail Mary,” (and there have been a few since), Staubach connected with wide receiver Drew Pearson on a 50-yard score with 24 seconds to play. It would help the Cowboys defeat the Vikings, 17-14. A week later, there was a 37-7 rout of the Rams at the Los Angeles Coliseum and then a well-earned trip to Super Bowl X.

This is a franchise that has been to eight Super Bowls and won five titles. But it’s their mystique over the years that have fascinated fans and naysayers alike. And Staubach-to-Pearson sums up things very nicely for this club.



Denver Broncos: Super Bowl XXXII win over Packers

The Denver Broncos won’t be defending their Super Bowl championship of a year ago. On Christmas night against the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium, Gary Kubiak’s team was eliminated from the postseason courtesy of a 33-10 loss.

For a long time, the franchise was associated more with losses in the Big Game than holding up their three Lombardi Trophies. And the club’s first NFL title was quite the resounding win.

You will recall that the Broncos came into their Super Bowl XXXII clash with the defending champion Green Bay Packers with a 0-4 resume on Super Sunday. Three of those setbacks came with quarterback John Elway at the controls. Now the veteran signal-caller and his wild card Broncos were back for another try.

Oh, by the way. Denver was looking to snap the NFC’s 13-game Super Bowl winning streak. Three of those AFC losses belonged to Elway and the Broncos (to the Giants, Redskins and 49ers) by a combined 136-40 score.

placeholder
Now the franchise was back in the Super Bowl for the first time in eight seasons. They would do it the hard way as a wild card, beating the Jaguars at home before grabbing wins at Kansas City and at Pittsburgh to make it to the big way.

In one of the best games of the series, the Broncos came away with a 31-24 victory over Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre and the Pack. Elway’s “whirlybird” run was the highlight of the contest. But the game MVP was running back Terrell Davis, who ran for 157 yards and three touchdowns in the upset victory. And say goodbye to those bad memories of four Super setbacks.

Detroit Lions: 1957 NFL championship season

You could argue that we could just insert 10 years of excellence from Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders and that would be a moment in itself. A few Charles Johnson highlights wouldn’t hurt as well.

placeholder
But the Detroit Lions are the only NFC team not to appear in a Super Bowl. The bright spots have been far and few between. Jim Caldwell’s club is currently 9-5 and in first place in the NFC North at the moment. They have a shot at winning their first division title since…1993. But they have a trip to Dallas coming up on Monday night and then a rematch with the Green Bay Packers. Aaron Rodgers and company held on for a 34-27 win three months ago at Lambeau Field.

As we mentioned, there hasn’t been a ton to cheer about for a franchise that hasn’t won a postseason game since 1991. But back in the 1950s, the franchise was busy winning capturing three NFL championships. The last of those came in 1957, a stunning 59-14 rout of the Cleveland Browns. The Lions’ quarterback was Tobin Rote, who enjoyed quite the day in the team’s 45-point victory. He completed 12-of-19 passes but those dozen connections added up to 280 yards and four touchdowns. Rote also ran for a score as Detroit rolled up 438 total yards in the win.

A week earlier, the Lions had to rally from a 27-7 deficit at San Francisco just to get to the NFL title game. It’s really the last great moment for this franchise, unless they do something pretty remarkable over the next four or five weeks.



Green Bay Packers: “The Ice Bowl”

No team has won more NFL championships than the Green Bay Packers. The number is 13 and perhaps counting if Aaron Rodgers and company remain hot for another month or so. Mike McCarthy’s club is currently 9-6 after their fifth consecutive win, a 38-25 rout of the Minnesota Vikings at Lambeau Field.

But there’s no game and better example of what epitomizes this franchise than the 1967 NFL Championship Game at storied Lambeau Field. It was a rematch from the previous year, when the Pack outlasted the Dallas Cowboys, 34-27, at the Cotton Bowl in Texas for the right to reach Super Bowl I.

Green Bay’s final drive against Tom Landry’s team in the face of unimaginable cold was simply legendary. A total of 68 yards would be covered by quarterback Bart Starr and running backs Donny Anderson and Chuck Mercein. That frozen tundra would prove to be a symbolic red carpet as Vince Lombardi’s club marched its way into NFL history.

On third down, trailing 17-14 and with just 16 seconds to play, Starr’s one-yard touchdown sneak thanks to guard Jerry Kramer and center Ken Bowman is one of those football images that is engrained in our memories.


Two weeks later, the Packers would defeat the Oakland Raiders, 33-14, at the Orange Bowl in Miami and Kramer and his teammates would carry Lombardi off the field on their shoulders. It would be his final game with the organization and Green Bay would not return to the Super Bowl for another 29 years.

The “Ice Bowl” is NFL history at its finest. And that 21-17 victory epitomizes the Packers and their impact on the game.

HOUSTON, TX – SEPTEMBER 8: Safety Kevin Williams

Houston Texans: win over Cowboys in 2002

On Christmas Even night at Houston, the Texans got an early present from a former draft choice of theirs. Cincinnati Bengals kicker Randy Bullock had a chance to beat the club that brought him into the league. But he pulled a 43-yards field goal attempt wide right on the final play of the game and Bill O’Brien’s club survived, 12-10.

It gave the Texans their second consecutive AFC South title and their fourth division crown in six years.

In this their 15th season in the NFL, the Houston Texans gave yet to reach a Super Bowl. They have won two postseason games but have yet to advance to a conference championship tilt.

Remember, this is a child still learning to walk. And while they remain one of only four franchises not to reach the Super Bowl, the Texans have not been at this all that long.


So when you think about an expansion team and what is has to overcome just to win a game, think of the excitement generated when you hit a home run in your regular-season debut. On a Sunday night at Houston and against their intrastate rivals, the Texans would come away with a surprising 19-10 victory over the stunned Dallas Cowboys. Led by head coach Dom Capers and piloted by rookie quarterback David Carr, Houston managed only 210 yards of total offense but did enough to get the victory. Carr would be sacked six times and picked off once but threw for a pair of scores in the victory.

The Texans would finish 4-12 that year and wouldn’t taste the playoffs until 2011. But that was some kind of opening-night performance.

BRONX, NY – DECEMBER 28: Alan Ameche

Indianapolis Colts: 1958 NFL Championship Game

To be frank, it was also one of the NFL’s greatest moments.

The Baltimore Colts and New York Giants would square off for the NFL championship of the 1958 season. It would be a game not settled in regulation. For the first time in the league’s brief history, there would be a fifth quarter to decide just who the best team in football was that year.

As most know, it turned into sudden death for the Giants at Yankee Stadium. Colts’ running back Alan Ameche scored the winning touchdown in the extra session to give Baltimore a 23-17 overtime victory. The contest was dubbed “The Greatest Game Ever Played,” although you would get a strong argument from many that it simply earned that distinction because we had never seen overtime before. But what it really did was put the struggling NFL on the map.

Still, it was the first of what would be four NFL championships by the franchise – three of those with Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas in the starting lineup. The Colts would face the Giants one year later in the title game and would have an easier time of it in Baltimore, 31-16.

Yes, the organization would go onto win Super Bowl V at the Orange Bowl following the 1970 season. The team overcame seven turnovers in an ugly 16-13 win. And 36 years later after that, game MVP Peyton Manning at the Indianapolis Colts would outlast the Chicago Bears in rainy South Florida, 29-17, in Super Bowl XLI.

Agree or not, anything that has the word “greatest” attached to it has to be pretty good.



27 Dec 1997: Quarterback Mark Brunell stands in the huddle with teammates, tight end Rich Griffith and running back Natrone Means of the Jacksonville Jaguars during a playoff game against the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium in Denver, Colorado. The

Jacksonville Jaguars: Win over Broncos in 1996 AFC Divisional Playoffs

They were in the midst of their second season in the NFL. The Jacksonville Jaguars were just over a year old, having finished 4-12 during their debut campaign of 1995. Led by head coach Tom Coughlin, this was a club growing up in a hurry.

With an offensive cast that included the likes of quarterback Mark Brunell, wide receivers Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell and left tackle Tony Boselli, the Jaguars would finish 9-7 in their follow-up campaign and grab a wild card playoff berth. But the team was just getting warmed up, to say the least.

The first stunner when it came to this club was a 30-27 upset of the Buffalo Bills at Orchard Park in the AFC Wild Card Playoffs. The franchise that was in the playoffs for the eighth time in nine seasons was felled by a club playing in only its 33rd overall game of existence.

But that was nothing compared to what the Jags had in store for the 13-3 Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium. Mike Shanahan’s club was expected to put the second-year club in its place in the Divisional Playoffs. But Jacksonville was clearly the better team this afternoon. Coughlin’s club rolled up 443 total yards, including 203 yards on the ground. Running back Natrone Means gashed the Broncos for 140 yards and a score on the ground. Brunell threw for 245 yards and two scores as he and his teammates rallied from a 12-0 first-quarter deficit for the upset.

It’s been a bad year for the Jaguars, although this week’s 38-17 win over the Tennessee Titans helps. But that playoff win in Denver put the franchise on the map pretty quickly.

NEW ORLEANS – JANUARY 11: Kansas City Chiefs’ quarterback Len Dawson

Kansas City Chiefs: Super Bowl IV win over Vikings

The Kansas City Chiefs are headed back to the playoffs for the third time in four years. With a postseason berth already clinched earlier in the day thanks to a Steelers’ win over Baltimore, Andy Reid’s club added an exclamation point by knocking the Denver Broncos out of contention with a 33-10 win.

Longtime football fans will recall another Christmas night in Missouri. It was the Chiefs and Miami Dolphins squaring off in the 1971 AFC Divisional Playoffs. Don Shula’s team would win, 27-24, in double overtime in what remains the longest game in league history.

But when you think about the Chiefs (born the Dallas Texans in 1960), it’s hard not to envision Pro Football Hall of Fame head coach Hank Stram being his entertaining self at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans in Super Bowl IV. In what would be the final game between the NFL and AFL before the 1970 merger, the Chiefs would administer a little punishment on quarterback Joe Kapp and the Minnesota Vikings. The 23-7 victory would substantiate the younger league even more considering that one year earlier, the New York Jets stunned the NFL’s Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III in Miami.

Simply put, there hasn’t been a lot to celebrate ever since. The Chiefs have yet to return to the Big Game and their last appearance in a conference championship was in 1993. The Andy Reid Era has provided a pair of playoff appearances and we could be seeing a third very soon. But “64 Toss Power Trap” is one of those storied play calls, made even more famous by Stram’s bubbling personality on the sideline those days. And a Super Bowl victory is still quite a memory.



Los Angeles Rams: 1999 Super Bowl season

It was head coach Dick Vermeil’s third year in the Gateway City at the controls of the St. Louis Rams.

The first two season had not gone well. But the longtime teacher could hardly be blamed for the franchise’s ineptitude during the decade.

Entering the 1999 season, the Rams owned a 45-99 win-loss record – the worst in the league entering the final campaign of the ‘90s. Under Vermeil, the club was a combined 9-23 in two seasons and there was plenty of play grumbling with the coach’s preparation tactics.

With little or no expectations, things were about to get worse for the team. In the preseason, quarterback Trent Green went down with a knee injury and an emotional Vermeil was forced to turn to the bench.

“We will rally around Kurt Warner. And we will play good football.”

That they did. The journeyman signal-caller and his club would stun the NFL. St. Louis finished 13-3 and Warner would throw for 4,353 yards, 41 scores and just 13 interceptions. Running back Marshall Faulk would total 1,000-plus yards both as a runner and a pass-catcher. Wideouts Isaac Bruce and rookie Torry Holt were inviting targets, both totaling more than 1,000 receiving yards.

Many kept waiting for the Rams’ unlikely bubble to burst. But it never happened. The season would conclude in Super Bowl XXXIV, where Vermeil’s squad held on for a 23-16 victory over the wild-card Tennessee Titans.Led by head coach Mike Martz, the team would return to the Big Game two years later but fell short to the upstart New England Patriots.

The Rams are the only team to win NFL titles as residents of three different cities (Cleveland, Los Angeles and St. Louis). And that third title was indeed the charm.

Miami Dolphins: 1972 “Perfect Season”

What else could we possibly be featuring when it comes to this franchise?

No, we won’t be highlighting one of the most famous plays in Super Bowl history. When it comes to famous sports bloopers, no list would be complete unless it featured Garo Yepremian’s failed pass attempt and fumble off a blocked field goal in Super Bowl VII. The miscue would be grabbed by Redskins defensive back Mike Bass, who returned the ball for Washington’s only touchdown in a 14-7 loss.

But it’s not that contest that is the onus here. It’s Miami’s 17-0 season and it remains the only example of perfection when it comes to not losing a game in the league’s 97-year history.

Some detractors of the accomplishment like to point to the Dolphins’ less-than-imposing schedule that year. Hey, you play who you have to play. And let’s not forget one of the oddities when it came to win No. 16 that year. Don Shula’s club had to travel to Pittsburgh to face the Steelers in the AFC title game. This was before the days of best win-loss records determining home field advantage. Miami came away with a 21-17 victory at since-demolished Three Rivers Stadium on the way to a date with the Redskins.

Pulling off a perfect season is a lot harder now that the schedule includes 16 games instead of 14. Regardless, the rare feat is one of the great moments in league history, much less one of the most important feats in Miami Dolphins’ annals.

Minnesota Vikings: 1998 season

There was a time when the Minnesota Vikings making a Super Bowl appearance were automatic. A team born out of expansion in 1961 would be playing for all the marbles eight years later.

Then again, we haven’t see the Purple Gang in the Big Game for 40 years. The team appeared in Super Bowl IV in 1969 and would then make three more appearances in a four-year span (VIII, IX and XI) from 1973-76. All four games resulted in defeat. In fact, these talented Vikings would never have the lead in any of those games – shut out in the first half in each contest.

But in 1998, head coach Dennis Green was in his seventh season at the helm of the club. The team used a first-round draft choice on wide receiver Randy Moss. It already had talent on both sides of the football with player such as running back Robert Smith and Hall of Fame wide receiver Cris Carter. That year, it would come all together and the Vikings would give us quite the show.

Led eventually by quarterback Randall Cunningham (Brad Johnson was the original starter), Minnesota would finish 15-1 and set a new NFL record with 556 points scored in a season. Moss set a rookie record with 17 touchdown receptions. Combined with an adequate defense, this looked like a club destined to reach and even win Super Bowl XXXIII.

As we found it, it wasn’t meant to be. The Vikings would lose the ’98 NFC title game at home in overtime to the Atlanta Falcons. While this club didn’t reach the Super Bowl, you could make a very strong case that it was the franchise’s best team.


New England Patriots: Introduction of team at Super Bowl XXXVI

The 16-year resume of the New England Patriots from 2001-16 is pretty amazing. There have been six Super Bowl appearances along the way, four resulting in victory.

Over that span, head coach Bill Belichick has produced a winning season each time. That run is tied for the second-longest such streak in NFL history, four years short of the Dallas Cowboys’ 20-season stretch from 1966-85. It’s also worth noting that the Pats have won at least 10 games every year since 2003. With Saturday’s 41-3 rout of the New York Jets, the club sits with an NFL-best 13-2 record at the moment.

There have been eight straight divisional titles dating back to 2009, another league record. Their eight consecutive postseason appearances are also one short of tying another NFL mark.

The league’s current dynasty began its run with a scintillating 20-17 victory over the heavily-favored St. Louis Rams at the Superdome. But before Belichick’s team took the field, they had decided that they would be introduced as a team that day in New Orleans. That was the team’s way of showing what they had achieved so far was bigger than one player. It’s one of many things that can be interpreted as the “Patriot Way.”

For those at the Superdome that day, it was somewhat surprising but very emotional. It was an NFL season that was interrupted in September by the unimaginable horror of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, as well as the heroics by those on Flight 93. The country needed a feel-good story and the Patriots delivered.

Tom Brady and company may well be on their way to another Super Bowl title in February. But that afternoon in the Crescent City would mean so very much.


New Orleans Saints: Return to the Superdome (2006)

It was the beginning of a new era in the Crescent City. At the same time, it was the rebirth of a community that had gone through unimaginable tragedy and destruction just one year earlier.

In 2005, Hurricane Katrina made a wasteland of New Orleans, Louisiana. The storm and the subsequent flooding left us with us horrifying pictures and too many deaths. The aftermath was a city in ruins. For its people, we would find out quickly they were not about to quit.

As for the football team, the Saints were unable to use the Superdome that season. It would be the site of much more important things such as a shelter for those who lost their homes. The club would play their home games in different sites throughout the country. The win-loss record isn’t even worth a mention for it was unimportant compared to real life.

But in ’06, the Saints were coming. That season, there was a new head coach in Sean Payton and a free-agent quarterback addition named Drew Brees. They would be a playoff team that year and would reach the NFC title game. Three years later, they would capture Super Bowl XXXIV in South Florida over the favored Indianapolis Colts.

However, it was the team’s first game back at the Superdome in Week 3 of ’06 that will always stand out as the key moment in the franchise’s amazing history. A video can speak louder than words and Steve Gleason continues to be a shining example of overcoming unimaginable odds.


New York Giants: Super Bowl XLII win over Patriots

Here is an interesting fact about New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning and his team’s championship runs in 2007 and 2001. Those are the only two years the veteran signal-caller has won playoff games. Of course, that’s still pretty damn good and it resulted in a pair of Super Bowl wins and game MVP awards.

This is a franchise that has won a total of eight NFL titles, four of those in the Super Bowl Era. One of those was an upset of the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV at Tampa in 1990. But the Giants outdid themselves in Arizona 17 years later against the powerhouse New England Patriots.

In Week 17 of the 2007 season, Bill Belichick’s team capped off a perfect regular season with a 38-35 comeback win over Tom Coughlin’s Giants in East Rutherford. New York took a 10-6 record into the postseason and the wild card club would win playoff games at Tampa, at Dallas and at Lambeau Field to reach Super Bowl XLII. They would face a New England club now 18-0 after a pair of postseason wins.

The Giants showed early on that this would be a different kind of game. They took the opening kickoff and burned 9:59 off the clock on the way to a 3-0 lead. The Patriots would respond with a touchdown drive but the score was still 7-3 in the fourth quarter.

Manning and his team came up with their share of memorable plays, the most storied his escape from the New England pass leading to wide receiver David Tyree’s helmet catch. Plaxico Burress caught the game-winner with 35 seconds to play and the 17-14 upset win was part of NFL lore.

MIAMI – JANUARY 12: Quarterback Joe Namath

New York Jets: Super Bowl III win over Colts

It’s one of the most famous games in the 97-year history of the league(s). We say it that way because the NFL merger actually took place on the field in 1970. But it had already been put in motion (hence the common draft in 1967) and began with the first four meetings between the AFL and NFL in a tradition that would become known as the Super Bowl.

In the first two editions, the dynasty known as the Green Bay Packers made somewhat easy work of both the Kansas City Chief (35-10) and Oakland Raiders (33-14). But future Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath and his New York Jets were about to put professional football on notice. However, Weeb Ewbank’s upstart club was a heavy underdog to fall to the NFL champion Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III at Miami’s Orange Bowl.

Most of the world knows what would happen that day in Florida. Don Shula’s Colts had their share of opportunities but would run into an underrated New York defense that frustrated Baltimore starting quarterback Earl Morrall for nearly the entire game. He was eventually pulled for Johnny Unitas, who didn’t fare much better against the Green and White.

New York’s 16-7 win changed the perception of the American Football League, now on the verge of an on-the-field merger with the NFL. Namath’s guarantee of a victory didn’t ensure any kind of win. But the results that day in Miami would prove the league’s newest acquisitions would eventually make the NFL even better.

TAMPA, FL – 1984: Running Back Marcus Allen

Oakland Raiders: Super Bowl XVIII win over Redskins

They’re back. For the first time since reaching Super Bowl XXXVII in 2002, the Silver and Black is returning to the playoffs. Unfortunately for the 12-3 Oakland Raiders, their quest for an appearance in Super Bowl LI just got a lot more difficult due to the loss of starting quarterback Derek Carr to a broken fibula.

It was a pretty miserable stretch for this franchise from 2003-15, amassing a record of 63-145 in those 13 seasons. And the last time this organization hoisted the Lombardi Trophy was an astounding 33 years ago in Tampa.

But what a game the then-Los Angeles Raiders played against the defending Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins that afternoon. Led by head coach Tom Flores, quarterback Jim Plunkett and eventual game MVP Marcus Allen, Al Davis’ warriors played as complete of game as you will ever see.

The Raiders got a pair of rushing touchdowns and 191 yards from Allen. His reversal of field and 74-yard run into the Washington end zone was simply amazing. Plunkett threw a touchdown pass to underappreciated wideout Cliff Branch. Linebacker Jack Squirek ran back a Joe Theismann interception for a score. And Flores’ club got the rout off to a good start with a blocked punt returned for a touchdown.

What made the win even more impressive was the fact that the Redskins had scored a then-NFL record 541 points during the regular season. They hung 51 more on the Rams and 24 on the 49ers in the NFC playoffs. But Joe Gibbs’ team was no match this day for a squad that clicked on every cylinder.

Philadelphia Eagles: 1960 NFL Championship Game

Yes, there have been a pair of Super Bowl appearances for the Philadelphia Eagles in both 1980 and 2004, both resulting in losses. The first probably stung a little more than the recent XXXIX loss to the New England Patriots a dozen years ago.

Going back, Dick Vermeil’s Birds had already beaten the Oakland Raiders earlier that season before laying an egg in Super Bowl XV at New Orleans.

In any case, the last time the Eagles tasted championship victory was back in 1960. Only the Cardinals (1947) and Lions (1957) have waited longer to win another NFL title. And obviously, the wait will be a little longer as Doug Pederson’s club won’t be headed to the playoffs.

As for that 17-13 victory over the Green Bay Packers a mere 56 years ago this week (December 26, 1960), it’s worth noting that it was the first and only postseason loss of head coach Vince Lombardi’s storied postseason career with the Green Bay Packers. Eagles’ quarterback Norm Van Brocklin threw for 204 yards and a touchdown (1 interception) as Philadelphia rallied for a touchdown in the fourth quarter down 13-10.

Yes, it was tempting to opt for anyone of the numerous “Miracle of the Meadowlands,” the first in 1978 and then 22 years later in 2010 at MetLife Stadium. But a league championship is hard to top regardless of those amazing heroics from the likes of Herman Edwards and DeSean Jackson during those respective afternoon. But the temptation to choose either was certainly there.


Pittsburgh Steelers: “The Immaculate Reception”

Dating back to the merger in 1970, no team in the NFL has won more regular-season games, more division crowns and more Super Bowls than the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Mike Tomlin’s team made it two AFC North titles in three years with a rousing 31-27 comeback win over the Baltimore Ravens on Christmas afternoon at Heinz Field.

The franchise was born in 1933 and took on the name Pirates before switching to Steelers. But nothing could change the fortunes of this downtrodden organization. Entering the 1972 season, the Black and Gold had appeared in one postseason game.

One.

But three years earlier, the team hired highly-regarded NFL assistant Chuck Noll as head coach. The organization made defensive tackle Joe Greene their first pick in ’69 and used the first overall selection in 1970 on quarterback Terry Bradshaw. The list would go on to include numerous Hall of Famers such as linebacker Jack Ham and running back Franco Harris.

The latter was a rookie on that ’72 team. After a slow start he would enjoy a very productive debut campaign. The Steelers would ride a surging defense and a strong running game into an 11-3 finish and an AFC Central title.

In the AFC Divisional Playoffs at home against the Oakland Raiders, Noll’s young team would trail 7-6 in the fourth quarter with only 22 seconds to play. Bradshaw would drop back on fourth down, look downfield and take aim at running back Frenchy Fuqua. There’s debate to this day that ball either hit Raiders’ safety Jack Tatum or Fuqua. There’s been little question who caught the ball. Harris scooped it up before in hit the ground, reached the end zone and the Steelers were finally playoff winners, 13-7. By the way, if the ball had hit Fuqua, this would have been an illegal play at that time.

The rest you know. In 1974, Noll and company won four Super Bowl titles in six years. The franchise has employed three head coaches since 1969 and each (Noll, Bill Cowher and Mike Tomlin) has reached at least two Super Bowls and won at least one. But it all began from a simple bounce of the ball.


San Diego Chargers: OT win over Dolphins in 1981 AFC Divisional Playoffs

The San Diego Chargers will be home for the playoffs for the third straight year. At 5-10, they are the only team this season assured of a losing record in the AFC West.

This is also a franchise that has made only one Super Bowl appearance in its 57-year history. Back in 1994, Bobby Ross’ Bolts were blown out by Steve Young and the San Francisco 49ers, 49-26, in South Florida. The Chargers last reached the AFC title game in 2007, falling to the New England Patriots in Foxborough.

However, it was those Don Coryell teams of the last 1970s and early ‘80s that surprisingly never reached the Big Game. There were near-misses in the 1980 and ’81 AFC Championship Games, the former a home loss to the divisional rival Oakland Raiders.

As for the latter, San Diego was left frozen in Cincinnati in a 27-7 loss in sub-zero temperatures. One week later, Hall of Famer Dan Fouts and a talented cast escaped with a victory in one of the most thrilling games in league history.

The Chargers would open up a quick 24-0 first-quarter lead. But before you could say “hook and ladder,” Miami would own a 38-31 fourth-quarter lead. It would be up to Fouts and running back James Brooks to help even the score, connecting for a touchdown with only 58 seconds to play. The Dolphins would have a chance to win in regulation but San Diego tight end Kellen Winslow would get a hand on a field goal attempt.

Late in a very busy overtime, Chargers kicker Rolf Benirschke booted a 29-yard field goal to give Coryell’s team the victory. Winslow would be carried off the field after catching 13 passes for 166 yards and a touchdown, to go along with his heroics on special teams. It’s not an NFL title, but it was those San Diego Chargers at their very best.

San Francisco 49ers: “The Catch”

So a franchise that has made six Super Bowl appearances and walked away with five championships is boiled down to one play?

Without the heroics of Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana and productive (and tall) wide receiver Dwight Clark in the closing moments of the 1981 NFC Championship Game, perhaps there is no dynasty.

The Niners had hit rock bottom in recent years before their surprising resurgence in ’81. Back-to-back showings of 2-1 came in 1978 and ’79, the latter under first-time NFL head coach Bill Walsh. The team would improve to 6-10 but no one seemed to sense what would be on the horizon.

In 1981, it all came together as the team overcame a 1-2 start to win 12 of its final 13 games. The 49ers were in the playoffs for the first time since 1972. And thanks to a victory over the New York Giants in the divisional round, they would host the Dallas Cowboys for the right to go to the Super Bowl.

It was an afternoon in which Walsh’s club would turn over the football six times. But it was also a game in which Montana and his offensive teammates got the ball back late in the fourth quarter at their own 11-yard line.

There would be 13 plays, including Montana’s memorable toss to Clark for a six-yard score with 51 seconds remaining. The PAT would give San Francisco a 28-27 victory and a ticket to Super Bowl XVI, where they would win and go onto capture a total of five championships in a 14-year span.

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ – FEBRUARY 02: Outside linebacker Malcolm Smith

Seattle Seahawks: Super Bowl XLVIII win over Broncos

Last week, the Seattle Seahawks wrapped up the NFC West and clinched a fifth consecutive playoff appearance. It was during the second year of this impressive run that Pete Carroll’s club left their impressive mark.

If all goes well, this is a club that could make a third Super Bowl appearance in four years. But by any stretch of the imagination it would be difficult to top what the ‘Hawks did in Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium against the favored Denver Broncos.

Simply put, it was one of the most complete beat-downs in this or any other big game. The Broncos came in scoring an NFL record 606 points during the regular season. They totaled a league-record 76 touchdowns in 16 contests. They held off the San Diego Chargers and New England Patriots in the AFC playoffs.

Two weeks later, Seattle obliterated John Fox’s club. They forced four turnovers and held Denver to 27 yards rushing on 14 carries. The Seahawks scored on offense, defense and special teams. They came away with a 43-8 win that wasn’t as close as the final score indicated.

Who would have guess that the highest-scoring team in one season in league annals would be held to double digits? Manning had three of the team’s turnovers, including a pick-six via Super Bowl MVP Malcolm Smith. Explosive Percy Harvin returned the second-half kickoff 87 yards for a touchdown. Quarterback Russell Wilson outshined Manning, throwing for 206 yards and a pair of scores.

The word would be thorough. And even if the Seahawks grab another championship down the road, it would be hard to top this performance against the stunned Broncos.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Super Bowl XXXVII win over Raiders

It was a franchise born of expansion back in 1976 that took its time when it came to winning.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have spent the vast majority of their existence being laughing stocks. They lost their first 26 games, a mark that still stands to this day (although the Cleveland Browns are currently making a run at that streak).

In 2002, Jon Gruden replaced Tony Dungy as head coach. The Bucs would finish 12-4 and head to the playoffs for the fifth straight year. Wins over the 49ers and Eagles enabled the team to reach Super Bowl XXXVII. When the smoked cleared that day in San Diego, Gruden and company walked away with a resounding 48-21 victory over the Oakland Raiders.

There’s a bit of irony here that some may not realize. As we noted, it took the Buccaneers 27 tries to win their first regular-season game. It was a 33-14 victory over the New Orleans Saints at the Superdome. It was a game in which Tampa defenders returned three interceptions for touchdowns.

As it turned out, it took the Buccaneers 27 seasons to win a Super Bowl. In their win over the Silver and Black, Jon Gruden’s defense would pick off 2002 NFL MVP Rich Gannon five times – three of those thefts taken back for scores by safety Dwight Smith (2) and Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker Derrick Brooks (1).

It’s been a long time since the Bucs held up that Lombardi Trophy. And it’s a new and promising era for a franchise that hasn’t been to the postseason since 2007. But this was the team’s shining moment.


Tennessee Titans: “The Music City Miracle”

It was your classic example of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. It was also a play that catapulted this franchise to its lone Super Bowl appearance.

In their first season as the Tennessee Titans, the team formerly known as the Houston Oilers got hot at the right time. Of course, Jeff Fisher’s squad was no slouch in 1999, finishing with a 13-3 record. But that was only good enough to finish second in the AFC Central that year to the 14-2 Jacksonville Jaguars. More on that later.

In the AFC Wild Card Playoffs, the Titans would host Wade Phillips’ Buffalo Bills and quarterback Rob Johnson, a controversial choice over Doug Flutie. Regardless, the Bills owned a 16-15 lead with a mere 16 seconds remaining on the clock.

Buffalo placekicker Steve Christie would kick off and fullback Lorenzo Neal fielded the ball at the Titans’ 24-yard line. He ran one yard before lateraling to Frank Wycheck. The productive tight end than lateraled to second-year wide receiver Kevin Tyson, who took it the remaining 75 yards and what proved to be the game-winning score in a 22-16 triumph. A win over the Colts at Indianapolis put the team in the AFC Championship Game against the aforementioned Jaguars.

That season, including playoffs, Tom Coughlin’s club was a combined 15-3. And all of those setbacks were to Fisher’s Titans, who won at Jacksonville, 33-14, on the way to a narrow loss to the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV. This is a franchise that hasn’t been to the playoffs since 2008 and still hasn’t won that elusive NFL title. But that win over the Bills remains one of the league’s classic plays.

MINNEAPOLIS, MN – JANUARY 26: Mark Rypien

Washington Redskins: 1991 Super Bowl championship season

The Washington Redskins are a franchise that have won five NFL titles, include three Super Bowl championships.

Of course, it is currently a team that hasn’t had that much success as of late. While the club has won a few division titles, most recently in 2012 and 2015, we haven’t seen this team in the Big Game or even in the NFC title tilt since 1991.

While some want to knock the team’s Super Bowl titles of 1982 and 1987 – seasons interrupted by players’ strikes – please keep this in mind. The first featured one of the great postseason performances in NFL history as Hall of Fame running back John Riggins dominated the competition in four playoff contests.

In ’87, Joe Gibbs’ squad put on a show for the ages in Super Bowl XXII…in one quarter. Quarterback Doug Williams threw four touchdown passes and his team gained 356 total yards in 15 minutes vs. the Denver Broncos.

But there was no debate about who the best team was in ’91. The Redskins jumped out to 11-0 start and would lose only two games all season. They had their way with the Atlanta Falcons (24-7), Detroit Lions (41-10) and Buffalo Bills (37-24) on the way to winning Super Bowl XXVI.

Quarterback Mark Rypien had a career year and was the game’s Most Valuable Player. He never really recaptured that form later on and the Redskins have been up and down ever since. What it showed was just how great a coach Gibbs was, hence his Hall of Fame status.

It been said that football, the NFL in general, transcends entertainment. It isn't something that the majority of us don't follow as a hobby or watch on our leisure time.  

Instead, football is a passion for us—it represents what is good about the American story and the history of this proud nation. From the Lambeau crazies in Green Bay to the Dog Pound in Cleveland. From the Black Hole in Oakland to the shirtless nuts all sprawled about in freezing winter weather along the east coast: football is America!

Many of us remember the seminal moment when we were growing up, either watching our team win the championship with our father, listening to it on the radio or being at the ultimate game. It was a part of our childhood and still brings back some of the fondest moments that we have. 

The NFL has just recently become "America's Pastime," surpassing baseball. However, the tradition of greatness that each franchise stands for can be seen throughout the NFL today. From "Curly's Packers" and "Halas' Bears" to "Walsh's 49ers" and "Belichick's Patriots," these memories define where the game came from and where it is going to go in the future.

Today, I am going to take a nostalgic look at the greatest moment from each franchises history. You will see moments that stopped time during the "progressive '50s," a team that re-united a broken city, and a man among boys stand strong in the face of defeat. 


Arizona Cardinals: The Impossible Dream Is Realized
1 of 32
2008 NFC Championship Game vs. Philadelphia Eagles

The Cardinals hadn't won a championship of any kind since they defeated the very same Philadelphia Eagles in the NFL Title Game some 50 years earlier. Prior to defeating the Carolina Panthers the week earlier, the Cardinals had one playoff win since 1948. 

Those 60 years spanned the cities of Chicago, St. Louis and Phoenix.

For all intent and purposes this was a dormant franchise, pretty much irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. This all changed in 2008 when a "washed up" quarterback, Kurt Warner, led Arizona to a 9-7 record and the NFC West title.

Arizona, who was an underdog in every postseason game they played, defeated the Atlanta Falcons and Carolina Panthers to make it to the NFC Championship against Philadelphia. The Eagles, who had been to the rodeo before under Donovan McNabb's leadership, were supposed to end Arizona's dream of a first Super Bowl appearance.

The Cardinals jumped out to a 24-5 halftime lead on three Kurt Warner touchdown passes to Larry Fitzgerald. It looked like the impossible dream was going to be realized. However, Philadelphia answered with 19 unanswered points—capped off with a 62-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson towards the start of the fourth quarter—and took a 25-24 lead.

Arizona answered in an emphatic way by driving down the field on a 14-play drive, which ended on a touchdown pass with less than three minutes remaining in the game.

It was over; Arizona would go to their franchise's first-ever Super Bowl.  


Atlanta Falcons: The Dirty Bird Rises in Atlanta
2 of 32
1998 NFC Championship Game at Minnesota Vikings

Like Arizona, the Atlanta Falcons had existed in mediocrity for the better part of their history. This was a team that found itself stuck behind both the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. 

Atlanta had won one playoff game over the course of the last 20 seasons and were spiraling towards the division cellar after making a rare playoff appearance in 1996. 

It was an unlikely figure, former seventh-round pick Jamal Anderson, that would lead them out of obscurity and into the promised land. The 1998 season saw Anderson gain over 1,800 yards rushing and score 14 touchdowns as Atlanta finished the regular year with a franchise-best 14 wins and the NFC West title. 

Still, they didn't have many believers as the Falcons would have to host the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round that season. They would intercept Steve Young three times in route to a 20-18 victory over San Francisco.

The following week, Atlanta capped off the best season in their history by defeating the then 16-1 Minnesota Vikings on the road. Morten Anderson nailed a 38-yard field goal in overtime, sending Atlanta to their first Super Bowl. Chris Chandler earned game MVP honors by throwing for 340 yards and three touchdowns.  

It was an amazing end to a great season, however, Atlanta would see defeat against Denver in the Super Bowl a couple weeks later. 


Baltimore Ravens: Ray Lewis and Co. Put the D in Victory
3 of 32
Super Bowl XXXV vs. New York Giants

The Baltimore Ravens, as they are known now, moved from Cleveland (Browns) in 1996, five seasons prior to their first Super Bowl appearance. A city that had a tremendous history with the Colts was ready to embrace a new franchise. However, the Ravens failed to have a winning season in their first four years in Baltimore. 

The fan base was growing weary. 

Then came 2000, when Baltimore's killer defense would tear apart the rest of the league. They finished No. 1 in the NFL in scoring defense, averaging just over 10 points per game. In fact, 11 opponents failed to 10 ten points on them in a game that season. Simply remarkable. 

Baltimore finished the regular year with a 12-4 record, earning a Wild Card spot in the AFC Central. Many people had questions as to whether their offense could pull it off. After all, they had switched from Tony Banks to the enigma that was Trent Dilfer halfway through the season. 

After giving up a total of 16 points in sweeping through the AFC playoffs, Baltimore would take on a New York Giants team that had just white-washed Minnesota 41-0 in the NFC Championship Game. 

While Super Bowl XXXV wasn't fun to watch if you loved offense, Baltimore's defense would come in and dominate. Led by eventual MVP Ray Lewis, the Ravens surrendered a total of 152 yards against New York in one of the most impressive defensive showings in Super Bowl history. Baltimore ended up pounding the Giants 34-7 for their first Super Bowl title. 

This also started a run of double-digit victories in six of the Ravens' next 11 seasons, which is likely to continue this year. 


Buffalo Bills: Biggest Comeback in Playoff History Adds to Legacy
4 of 32
1992 AFC Wild Card Playoffs vs. Houston Oilers 

I could have easily picked any one of the four consecutive AFC Championship games that Buffalo won from 1990-1993. Instead, I decided to pick what many consider to be the greatest comeback in the history of the NFL. 

Buffalo had finished the regular season with an 11-5 record after losing three of their final five games. This caused them to have to play in a Wild Card playoff game that season. Many people expected Warren Moon and the Houston Oilers to come into Buffalo and take this game. After all, Houston has finished much better than the Bills, winning four of their last five games. 

It sure looked like that was going to be the case, especially after they had defeated Buffalo in the regular season finale 27-3 to qualify to the playoffs. 

Houston jumped all over Buffalo 35-3 in the third quarter as the game appeared to get out of hand. Boos were being heard from all over Rich Stadium as a shocked fanbase endured the massacre. 

With Jim Kelly out to injury and long-time backup Frank Reich thrown into service, it appeared there was no denying the obvious. However, Buffalo would score 38 of the game's final 41 points, capped off by a 38-yard field goal by Steve Christie in overtime. Reich's four second-half touchdown passes became a masterpiece of their own, but none of this would have been possible if Houston hadn't completely melted down as the game progressed. 

It became known as the "comeback" as Buffalo would make an unprecedented third consecutive trip to the Super Bowl. 


Carolina Panthers: 1996 Divisional Playoffs, Young Panthers Roar
5 of 32
1996 NFC Divisional Playoffs At Dallas Cowboys

The Dallas Cowboys were the defending Super Bowl Champions and had won three of the last four titles. They featured four future Hall-of-Fame players in Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin and Deion Sanders. On the other hand, Carolina was in just their second season of existence in the NFL. 

There was absolutely no way the young Panther squad could go into the "Big D" and compete with "America's Team," right? Wrong!

Carolina had finished the regular season with seven consecutive wins and were as hot as any team in the NFL. Their 30-24 Week 15 victory over another powerhouse, the San Francisco 49ers, made this team believe in itself, and that is all they needed. 

The Panthers intercepted Troy Aikman three times and defeated the heavily-favored Cowboys 26-17 for the franchise's first-ever playoff victory. 


Chicago Bears: Super Bowl XX, the Shuffle Becomes America's Dance
6 of 32
Super Bowl XX vs. New England Patriots 

The 1985 Chicago Bears were arguably the best football team ever built. This is a team that went 15-1 during the regular season, outscoring their opponents by an average of 16.1 points per game. In fact, they finished second in scoring offense and first in scoring defense. 

The team boasted five future Hall-of-Fame players and a Hall-of-Fame coach. Their only loss of the regular season came in a game against the Miami Dolphins, in which Jim McMahon was injured. 

So, there was no surprise that they were the odds-on favorites to win the Super Bowl in 1985. Following their remarkable regular season, Chicago set a modern NFL record by shutting out their first two postseason opponents: New York Giants and Los Angeles Rams. They gave up just over 300 yards of combined offense in the two games and forced a total of four turnovers. 

Following the destruction of their NFC opponents, Chicago would take on an upstart New England Patriots club that had won 12 of their last 14 games overall. Still, the Bears were heavily favored. 

Super Bowl XX ended up being the most lopsided game in Super Bowl history at that time. Chicago won 46-10 as the Bears defense allowed a total of eight rushing yards and forced six turnovers. 

Fittingly, Richard Dent won the game's Most Valuable Player after acquiring two sacks, but it was a total defensive onslaught. 

The 1972 Miami Dolphins and 1994 San Francisco 49ers, among others, have legitimate arguments as the best team ever assembled. However, this Chicago Bears unit was so dominating it is hard to look past them. 


Cincinnati Bengals: The Freezer Bowl Freezes out Fouts and the Chargers
7 of 32
1981 AFC Championship Game vs. San Diego Chargers

Prior to the 1980s and since that decade, there hasn't been much to go right for the Cincinnati Bengals. They had not won a playoff game until the 1981 season after being in the NFL for 14 seasons, and since 1990 the Bengals have had only two winning campaigns. 

Still, this team surprised a lot of people with their success in the 1980s. And it all began in the year of my birth: 1981.

Cincinnati finished the regular season 12-4 behind great quarterback play from Ken Anderson and an offense that saw them score over 420 points. The San Diego Chargers finished 1981 with a 10-6 record and were decided underdogs. 

The story of the AFC Championship Game was the weather situation in Ohio. The temperature was negative nine degrees with windchill hitting negative 37 during game time. It is safe to say that a team from California wasn't ready for the climate. 

The Cincinnati Bengals took full advantage, forcing four turnovers, two of them coming off interceptions of Dan Fouts. They would go onto to win the coldest game in NFL history 27-7 to go to the Bengals' first Super Bowl. 

Two weeks later Cincinnati would falter against the San Francisco 49ers in much more hospitable conditions. But, for a franchise that had struggled for so long, this one win meant so much to the fans and the city. 


Cleveland Browns: 1964 NFL Championship, Yes Cleveland Has a Sports Title
8 of 32
1964 NFL Championship Game: Cleveland Browns vs. Baltimore Colts

The Baltimore Colts were led by Johnny Unitas, Lenny Moore and Raymond Berry. The Cleveland Browns had their own stars in Jim Brown and Paul Warfield. This NFL Championship Game was going to be something for the ages, right? 

Well, Jim Brown combined for a total of 140 yards and Frank Ryan tossed four touchdown passes, Meanwhile, Johnny Unitas was held for less than 90 passing yards, and Raymond Berry had 40 total yards as the Browns shutout the favored Colts 27-0 to win the title. 

This is still the last major sports title that the city of Cleveland has ever won. You can thank Earnest Byner and Edgar Renteria for that. 


Dallas Cowboys: Super Bowl XXX, Dallas Avenges Previous Super Bowl Defeats
9 of 32
Super Bowl XXX vs. Pittsburgh Steelers

Some franchises just have too many options, and it becomes extremely hard to pick out one defining moment. I had this issue with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Green Bay Packers, San Francisco 49ers and these Dallas Cowboys. 

That said, Super Bowl XXX has to be their seminal moment as a franchise. The Pittsburgh Steelers had beaten Dallas in both of their previous Super Bowl matchups, both in a matter of four years, Super Bowl X and XIII. Additionally, the Steelers were a perfect 4-0 in the big game. 

The year was 1995, Dallas had won two of the previous three Super Bowls and Pittsburgh hadn't been to a Super Bowl in 15 years. This game matched up two of the league's most storied franchises. 

Dallas had gone through the regular season with a third consecutive 12-win season. They were headed by the "triplets" on offense, and Emmitt Smith was coming off his single greatest season as a pro. Pittsburgh, on the other hand, was a team built from scratch. It consisted of journeymen veterans and young up-and-coming stars.

There was no reason to believe that the Steelers could hang with Dallas in the Super Bowl. Still, the memories of Lynn Swann and Terry Bradshaw enabled the Cowboys to feel a need for revenge when it came time for Super Sunday.

It wasn't the normal playmakers who had success for Dallas in this game, which is what makes it so much more amazing. Troy Aikman threw for just over 200 yards, Emmitt Smith averaged just 2.6 yards per rush and Michael Irvin only had four receptions.

Then came the play that came to define Neil O'Donnell's career with the Pittsburgh Steelers and gave Larry Brown a huge payday with Oakland a few months later. Pittsburgh had come scratching back from a 20-7 halftime deficit to pull the game within three, before Brown picked him off for a second time.

Dallas converted both those interceptions into touchdowns, which was the difference in a 27-17 win. The Cowboys became the first team to win three Super Bowl titles in four seasons.


Denver Broncos: John Elway's Monkey Says Goodbye
10 of 32
Super Bowl XXXII vs. Green Bay Packers

Prior to the 1997 season, John Elway had led the Denver Broncos to nine winning seasons and three Super Bowl appearances, but a championship was elusive. Denver had been outscored 136-40 in their last three Super Bowls under Elway, who was entering the twilight of his career. 

It took the former Stanford star to find a running game with Terrell Davis before he was able to have a complete team and win the title. 

That season was 1997. Denver finished 12-4 and earned a Wild Card spot out of the AFC West. It didn't seem like there were many expectations that this season was going to be any different. Kansas City finished 13-3 that season to earn the division crown. Denver, on the other hand, had lost two of their final three games, having to settle for second place. 

The Jacksonville Jaguars proved no test for Denver in the Wild Card playoffs, so it was on to Arrowhead for the test against the division champions. Denver would go into Kansas City and win the game 14-10, the next week they took care of business against Pittsburgh by forcing Kordell Stewart into four turnovers. This wrapped up the AFC Title for the Broncos, who would now take on the defending Super Bowl Champion Green Bay Packers. 

Brett Favre's Packers came in as the favorites, but it was Terrell Davis who stole the show. He ran for over 150 yards and scored three touchdowns to earn the MVP award. 

Denver would go onto to win back-back titles the next season by defeating the Atlanta Falcons in John Elway's final game. 


Detroit Lions: 1957 NFL Championship Game, Tobin Rote Does It Again
11 of 32
1957 NFL Championship Game vs. Cleveland Browns

A lot of you Lions fans who are excited about the success of your team this season do not remember the team's last title. To be real, it happened a quarter-century before I even came into existence. But for you older fans, enjoy the video that I have embedded; hopefully it brings back some good memories. 

This was a time when the Cleveland Browns and Detroit Lions were the two best teams in the entire NFL. They had played for the title four times in seven seasons in the 1950's, with 1957 being the final matchup. 

For Detroit, future Hall-of-Fame quarterback Bobby Layne was injured, so the game would rest on the shoulder of of former Packers All-Star Tobin Rote. The backup quarterback threw for four scores and ran for another one, while Detroit's defense held Jim Brown to just 69 yards on 20 rushes.

The Lions would go on to win the game 59-14, marking their third title in six seasons. Detroit hasn't seen a championship since. 

Green Bay Packers: A Starr Is Born and a Trophy Is Named After Lombardi
12 of 32
Super Bowl I vs. Kansas City Chiefs

This game wasn't even known as the Super Bowl yet; rather it was hailed as the first AFL-NFL Championship Game. The Green Bay Packers had won three NFL titles under Vince Lombardi, with Bart Starr as the quarterback. Meanwhile, Len Dawson had led the Kansas City Chiefs to an AFL title in 1962. 

This game pitted the best from each league and started what we now call the Super Bowl era, which currently transcends sports. 

The game itself wasn't anything to write home about. Green Bay, the huge favorites from the NFL, destroyed Kansas City 35-10. Bart Starr threw for 250 yards and Max McGee caught seven passes for 139 yards. 

More than the outcome of the game was the fact that this began an era in football where it would eventually become America's pastime and the most popular sport in the world. Vince Lombardi would later have the trophy named after him and Bart Starr will always be remembered as the first Super Bowl MVP. 

Houston Texans: David Carr Shows Dallas Who the King of Texas Really Is
13 of 32
Houston Texans' Inaugural Game vs. Dallas Cowboys in 2002

We don't have a lot to work with in regards to the newest franchise in the NFL. Houston has yet to make it to the playoffs in their nine seasons of existence. Still, their first game was an in-state matchup against "America's Team," the Dallas Cowboys, and it was one for the ages.

Houston came in as 14-point underdogs against a team that had won three Super Bowl titles over the last decade. The Texans won their first game ever when Davis Carr connected with Corey Bradford on a 65-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter to take a 17-10 lead. 

Dallas, led by Quincy Carter, was unable to answer, and the Texans won their inaugural game against the Dallas Cowboys. 


Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts: 1958 NFL Championship, Ameche the Giants Killer
14 of 32
1958 NFL Championship Game, Baltimore Colts vs. New York Giants

This game has been called the "greatest ever played." It pitted the heavily-favored Baltimore Colts with the likes of Johnny Unitas, Alan Ameche, Lenny Moore and Raymond Berry against the New York Giants, who had won the NFL title in 1956.

It was the 26th annual NFL Championship Game but was the first one to be aired nationally when NBC picked up the rights for the game. Many historians believe that this was the game that set the NFL on the path to becoming the most-watched sport in the world. 

The game was tied at 17-17 after regulation, thus marking the first time that a NFL Championship game had gone into overtime. Following a three-and-out by the New York Giants, Baltimore would begin a drive that was heard around the world. 

They set forth on 13-play, 80-yard drive that was capped off by a one-yard touchdown run by Alan Ameche on third down. Following the game-winning score, hundreds of fans mobbed the Baltimore Colts from the east end zone of Yankee Stadium. 

Not only was this the biggest game in Baltimore Colts history, it probably has to go down as the most important game in the history of the NFL. For that, it has to be No. 1. 


Jacksonville Jaguars: Dolphin Destruction in Florida
15 of 32
1999 AFC Divisional Playoffs: Miami Dolphins at Jacksonville Jaguars

The Miami Dolphins had controlled football in Florida since they came into existence in 1966. The Jacksonville Jaguars were just in their fifth year of existence as a franchise. Despite all this, Jacksonville came into the playoffs as huge favorites to defeat Dan Marino and the Dolphins.

Jacksonville had made the playoffs in each of their previous three seasons, setting an expansion-team record. Miami, on the other hand, was nearing the end of their run with Marino. 

The two came together on the just 15th day of the new millennium, and the history of the NFL would be forever changed. 

The Jaguars jumped out to a 24-0 first-quarter lead behind two offensive and a defensive touchdown. They tacked on another 17 points in the second stanza before Dan Marino threw a touchdown pass to bring the score to 41-7 at halftime. 

Even with Mark Brunell pulled from the game, Jay Fiedler came in to throw two second-half touchdown passes and lead Jacksonville to three more scores. By the time the final second ticked off, Jacksonville had the biggest victory in NFL playoff history, beating the Miami Dolphins 62-7. 

Jacksonville went on to lose to Tennessee the next week, but this one game represented a historic milestone for the young franchise. 


Kansas City Chiefs: Super Bowl IV, the Lenny and Otis Show
16 of 32
Super Bow IV: Kansas City Chiefs vs. Minnesota Vikings

Kansas City had played in the first-ever Super Bowl a couple years back but lost to a much better Green Bay Packers team. This season they would act the part of champions during the regular season. 

The Chiefs finished 1969 with a 11-3 record, two of their losses coming against division-rival Oakland. They finished second in scoring offense and first in scoring defense. 

However, the ultimate test would come against the AFL's best team, the Oakland Raiders, in the Conference Championship Game. Kansas City avenged two regular-season losses by defeating the Raiders in Oakland, 17-7. 

Then a week later it was the heavily-favored Minnesota Vikings who would feel the wrath of this Kansas City team still upset over the loss to Green Bay a few seasons back. The Chiefs intercepted Joe Kapp twice, and Otis Taylor caught six passes, including a touchdown, to lead them to the Super Bowl title 23-7. 

This is still the only Super Bowl that Kansas City has won. 


Miami Dolphins: Super Bowl VII, Fins Show the Skins What Perfect Means
17 of 32
Super Bowl VII: Miami Dolphins vs. Washington Redskins

Not only was Miami looking to become the only undefeated team in NFL history, they were looking to avenge a Super Bowl loss at the hands of the Dallas Cowboys a season earlier. 

Miami wasn't just the best team in the NFL in 1972, they dominated in every possible way. The Fins outscored their opponents by an average of 15.2 points per game that season in route to first in both offense and defense. 

Their top-ranked offense was led by a three-headed running back group that consisted of Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick and Mercury Morris, who combined for for over 3,000 total yards and 25 touchdowns. Their defense consisted of a bunch of no-names led by five-time Pro Bowler Jake Scott. 

After running the table with a 14-0 regular season record, the Dolphins' first playoff test came against the Cleveland Browns. Miami was losing 14-13 in the fourth quarter when the run game set sail and Jim Kiick scored on a eight yard touchdown to give Miami a 20-14 win. A week later, Miami took care of business against Terry Bradshaw and the Pittsburgh Steelers, scoring on three touchdown runs. 

Now it was on to the Super Bowl after two surprisingly close AFC playoff games. Miami dominated the first half of the Super Bowl against Washington, jumping out to a 14-0 halftime lead. Following a scoreless third quarter, Washington made it a game by blocking a Miami field goal attempt and returning it for a touchdown. This play became known as the Garo's Gaffe."

However, Miami would hold on to the 14-7 lead behind solid defensive play and running down the clock on the ground. At the end, the Dolphins became NFL's first and only truly "perfect team," finishing the season 17-0.

Minnesota Vikings: Last Super Bowl Appearance in the Mud
18 of 32
1976 NFC Championship Game: Los Angeles Rams at Minnesota Vikings

The Minnesota Vikings had been to three Super Bowls in their history, only to lose all three, all by double digits. Fran Tarkenton had an "X" on his face for being a player who couldn't win the big game. The 1976 season came in what would probably be his final chance to prove skeptics wrong at the age of 37. 

Minnesota finished the season with a 11-2-1 record behind a stifling defense that allowed barely over 12 points per game. The nucleus of that unit was nine time Pro-Bowl defensive tackle Alan Paige. On offense, the Vikings relied on a controlled passing game and smash-mouth running game led by Chuck Foreman. It wasn't pretty, but they won games. 

They took on the NFC West Champion Los Angeles Rams, who averaged over 25 points per game and were led by All-Pro running back Lawrence McCutcheon. 

The game would take place outside in Minnesota, imagine that. Rain had hit hard the previous night and the weather broke prior to kickoff. In the sloppiness of the performance, Minnesota came out ahead, 24-13 with Foreman gaining nearly 200 yards of offense. 

This was the last NFC Championship that the Minnesota Vikings would win under Tarkenton, and they have not been back to the Super Bowl since. Unfortunately, they got blown out by another California team, the Oakland Raiders, 32-14 in the Super Bowl.


New England Patriots: Moss and Brady Finish Perfect, Records Fly into Obscurity
19 of 32
2007 Regular Season: New England Patriots at New York Giants

Prior to the mid-1990's you probably would have had to go back to the days that this franchise called themselves the Boston Patriots to find the greatest moment in its history. Since then, there probably have been at least six or seven of said moments. 

I may get some criticism for not going with any of the Patriots' three Super Bowl Championships, and I easily could have. However, no one can deny how monumental this game actually was. 

First, New England was on the verge of finishing the regular season with the best record in NFL history. Second, Tom Brady needed two touchdowns to break Peyton Manning's single-season touchdown record. Finally, Randy Moss needed just as many touchdowns to break Jerry Rice's single-season touchdown reception record. 

Well, it all occurred on one play in one game. With the Patriots trailing 28-23 in the fourth quarter and on the verge of losing their "perfect season," Tom Brady went up top to Randy Moss and the ball traveled incomplete. 

On the very next play, Brady went towards Moss once again. This time down the right hash, he hit the future Hall-of-Fame receiver in stride, who took it the distance for a touchdown. New England took a 31-28 lead and never looked back.

On one play three of the greatest records in NFL history fell. Manning's single-season touchdown pass record was gone, Jerry Rice's touchdown record was a thing of the past, and the 1972 Miami Dolphins were no longer alone as the only undefeated team (regular season) in NFL history. 

New England wouldn't finish the postseason undefeated, as the very same New York Giants would go on to defeat them in the Super Bowl. Still, you have to look back to that night in New Jersey with awe. 


New Orleans Saints: Who Dat Nation Becomes America's Team for a Day
20 of 32
Super Bowl XLIV: New Orleans Saints vs. Indianapolis Colts

The city of New Orleans had just been shattered with the worse natural disaster in American history a couple years before, Hurricane Katrina. More than 1,000 people died, and one of the most fabulous areas in the world was a destruction zone. 

Then, "Who Dat Nation" arrived. Six months after the disaster destroyed the city, Drew Brees went against any possible logic and signed with the New Orleans Saints; the rest was history. 

Three years later, New Orleans finished the regular season with a 13-3 record, finishing first in scoring offense. Drew Brees threw for nearly 4,400 yards and 34 touchdowns. Nothing like that ever been accomplished in the "Big Easy."

With home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, the Saints would beat off their NFC opponents in front of a passionate crowd in the very same building that thousands took refuge in during Katrina. New Orleans defeated the Arizona Cardinals 45-14 in the NFC Divisional Playoffs to set up a matchup against the Minnesota Vikings for the NFC title.

The story lines were great in this game. Minnesota had not been to the Super Bowl in over a quarter-century, New Orleans had never been there and the backdrop was the "Big Easy." New Orleans would go on to to win 31-28 in overtime.

Now Super Bowl XLIV came upon the United States, and for one day New Orleans was "America's Team'"—if you were not a f of the Indianapolis Colts, you became a Saints fan for that day.

With the Saints up 24-17 in the fourth quarter, Indianapolis was driving and had the ball near the red zone. Peyton Mannning dropped back to pass and flung the ball into the hands of Tracy Porter, who returned the interception 74 yards for a game-clinching touchdown.

That was it, New Orleans had done the impossible and won their first Super Bowl title.


New York Giants: Manning and Co. Show the Patriots Perfection Isn't Possible
21 of 32
Super Bowl XLII: New England Patriots vs. New York Giants 

The New England Patriots came into Super Bowl XLII with an 18-0 record. In those 18 games, New England outscored their opponents by a whopping 335 points, the most ever in NFL history. For all intents and purposes they were the greatest team ever assembled. Tom Brady and Randy Moss had just broken single-season touchdown records against these very same Giants weeks earlier.  

No chance, right? It just couldn't happen. No way that a team that went 10-6 during the regular season and struggled through two consecutive single-digit playoff victories could match whits with the "great" New England Patriots. 

With New England leading 14-10 late in the fourth quarter, it looked like they were on the verge of football immortality. The Giants wouldn't have any of it. On third down near midfield, Eli Manning dropped back and was nearly sacked, he stumbled backwards and threw a desperation pass in the air. David Tyree jumped what seemed like 10 feet in the air and came down with the ball. It was the single greatest catch that most of us had ever seen, and it prolonged the drive. 

Then with just over 30 seconds remaining Eli Manning connected with Plaxico Burress in the left corner of the end zone for a touchdown to give the Giants a lead they would never relinquish. 

The greatest upset in the history of the Super Bowl (sorry New York Jets fans) was now complete, and New York had done the impossible. 




New York Jets: Broadway Joe Tells the NFL Glamour Works Too
22 of 32
Super Bowl III: New York Jets vs. Baltimore Colts 

The AFL champion had lost the first two Super Bowls to the NFL by a combined 68-24. It was apparent what league ruled American football. The American Football League just couldn't compare to the National Football League, and many people were becoming skeptical that this game would last. 

Well, did it ever. 

"Broadway" Joe Namath was the quarterback for the AFL Champion New York Jets. Prior to the big game he had guaranteed a victory. This remarkably ignorant comment became locker room material for Johnny Unitas and the heavily-favored Baltimore Colts. Additionally, New York tabloids took to the comment in mass, complaining that Namath was among the most ignorant professional athlete in the world. 

Well?

The 12-3 New York Jets had just barely beaten the upstart Oakland Raiders in the conference championship game; Baltimore on the other hand, had finished their season 13-1 and just destroyed the Cleveland Browns in the conference title game.

Joe Namath wasn't scared, rather he loved the underdog role, as evidenced in this photo of him sitting pool-side when guaranteeing the win.

Despite calling for the victory, Namath didn't throw a touchdown in the Super Bowl and completed just over half of his passes. This was better than how Johnny Unitas fared, however; he only threw for 110 yards with an interception and zero touchdowns. 

The game came down to defense and field goals. After taking an initial 7-0 lead on a Matt Snell touchdown run, the Jets would convert three consecutive drives into field goals for a 16-0 lead. The Baltimore Colts and rest of the nation were in complete shock. Baltimore would tack on a touchdown, but the game was already settled. The Jets had fulfilled Namath's guarantee and defeated the mighty Baltimore Colts. 


Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders: Big Al Gets the Title He Deserves
23 of 32
Super Bowl XI: Oakland Raiders vs. Minnesota Vikings

When Al Davis became the head coach of the Oakland Raiders in 1963, they had just finished a 1-13 season. It would take time, but Mr. Davis would commit to excellence. 

Over the next 13 years the Raiders would become one of the winningest teams in football, but that elusive Super Bowl title didn't come. Still, Al Davis stuck with his man John Madden. 

Then in 1976, the Raiders had arguably their best season before or since, going 13-1 during the regular season. They weren't dominant by any stretch of the imagination, winning nine games by single digits. This was a direct reflection of John Madden, who was hand-picked by Al Davis to be their head coach years before despite criticism that the former had never even been a coordinator in the league. Well, this loyalty paid off. 

Then the Super Bowl came in Pasadena, California. It pitted the Minnesota Vikings and Frank Tarkenton against the upstart Oakland Raiders. Not many people outside of Northern California had heard of Clarence Davis or Mark Van Eeghen, but they would prove to be the difference in a Super Bowl filled with stars—they ran foa combined 210 yards to give the Raiders a 32-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. 

A promise that Al Davis had made some 14 years earlier had come to fruition: Oakland finally had their Super Bowl title.

Philadelphia Eagles: Miracles Can Happen in the Meadowlands Too
24 of 32
1978 Regular Season: Philadelphia Eagles at New York Giants

I could go back to the 1950s and 1960s with Norm Van Brocklin, but this game meant so much more for the city of Philadelphia. Yes, it was a regular season game, and feel free to disagree with me. 

The Eagles had just completed 11 consecutive seasons of futility. In fact, they had won 42 games over the last decade without making the playoffs. Philadelphia entered the game with a 6-5 record and a chance to make the playoffs.

The New York Giants were winning 17-12 and had the ball with less than a minute left, while Philadelphia didn't have a timeout. The game was pretty much over until John McVay and the New York Giants made the odd decision not to kneel on the ball. Instead, they ran a run play to Larry Csonka on second down. Quarterback Joe Pisarcik fumbled the handoff, and Eagles cornerback Herman Edwards returned it 26 yards for the game-winning touchdown. 

It might not compare to the games of the 1950s and 1960s, but this one did a whole lot for an Eagles franchise bordering on irrelevancy. They would go on to lose in the first round of the playoffs against the Atlanta Falcons in a heart-breaker. 

But, it gave the "city of brotherly love" some reason to actually love once more. 


Pittsburgh Steelers: Immaculate Reception Begins a Dynasty
25 of 32
1972 AFC Championship Game: Oakland Raiders at Pittsburgh Steelers

Now, I have no idea why none of the six, count them six, Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl titles don't sit atop this list, but they just pale in comparison, if you ask me. 

The year was 1972; Pittsburgh had seen just four winning seasons since their creation in 1933 as the Pirates. This team had been a bottom feeder for so long, and no one expected that to change either. 

However, one play came to define the Pittsburgh Steelers franchise. 

Pittsburgh had finished 1972 with a surprising 11-3 record behind fourth-year head coach Chuck Knoll, who went 12-30 in his first three seasons. Steelers starting quarterback Terry Bradshaw had also thrown nearly 30 more interceptions than touchdowns in his first two seasons after being selected No. 1 overall from Louisiana Tech in 1970. 

It just didn't make sense that they had the nucleus to succeed, and "Steel City" fans were becoming upset at the franchise. 

Pittsburgh took to the playoffs after winning nine of their last 10 regular season games behind what we now call the "Steel Curtain." Then came the matchup against an equally tough opponent, the Oakland Raiders in the conference title game. 

With Pittsburgh winning 6-0, Kenny Stabler ran for a 30-yard touchdown with 1:17 remaining in the fourth quarter to give the Raiders a 7-6 lead, making the game was pretty much over. On fourth-and-10 from their own 40 and less then 30 seconds remaining, Terry Bradshaw dropped back in desperation and thew the ball up the middle; it collided with an unnamed Steeler player and Raiders linebacker Jack Tatum, and Franco Harris picked the ball up out of mid-air and ran 60 yards for the game-winning touchdown. 

Pittsburgh did not win the Super Bowl that season, but it did set them on a collision path with one of the greatest feats in the history of the NFL. They went on to win four Super Bowls in six seasons from 1974-1979. 


San Diego Chargers: Natrone Meant Business
26 of 32
1994 AFC Championship Game: San Diego Chargers at Pittsburgh Steelers 

The San Diego Chargers had been a successful franchise for the last 15 seasons, winning double-digit games in six of those seasons. Still, Dan Fouts couldn't get them the title under "Air Coryell," and they were facing a Pittsburgh Steelers team that had not made the Super Bowl in nearly a quarter century. 

Something had to give, and boy, did it ever. 

San Diego, coming off a 11-5 regular season that saw them win the AFC West, had just barely escaped the Miami Dolphins 22-21 a week earlier. They didn't have a whole bunch of stars, instead it was a team effort with players of average talent that led them to the AFC Championship Game. Pittsburgh, on the other hand, had finished 12-4 and were the overwhelming favorites with at home and with the weather at a surprising 59 degrees. 

The game lasted three quarters with Pittsburgh leading 13-10, but Stan Humphries connected with Tony Martin on a 43-yard touchdown pass in the fourth to give San Diego the lead. A few minutes later, Neal O'Donnell led Pittsburgh down the field for a possible game-winning touchdown drive. On fourth down with just over a minute left from the Chargers six, O'Donnell attempted a pass up the middle to Barry Foster, but it was broken up by "the great" Dennis Gibson to nail a Chargers victory and their first appearance in the Super Bowl. 

San Diego went on to lose the Super Bowl to San Francisco 49-26, but that one moment vindicated years of playoff frustration for the franchise. 


San Francisco 49ers: One Dynasty Begins, Another Ends
27 of 32
1981 NFC Championship Game: Dallas Cowboys at San Francisco 49ers 

There really are a lot of different choices I could have gone with here. Seriously, this is a team that dominated the landscape of the NFL for nearly two decades. During that span they won five Super Bowls. However, I am not going to go with any of those Super Bowl victories; instead, I am going to focus on a game that sent 'America's Team" packing and created a new dynasty in the NFC. 

It is the 1981 NFC Championship game, better known as "The Catch."

San Francisco had been to the playoffs four times in the last 42 seasons and just finished going 10-38 in their last three campaigns. It seemed that the 1981 season was going to be no different under third-year head coach Bill Walsh, who had a combined 8-24 record at the time. San Francisco started the season 1-2 with losses against Detroit and Atlanta. Joe Montana didn't look too impressive and was possibly looking at the pine following a two-interception performance against Atlanta in the second of those two defeats. 

After defeating the New York Giants 38-24 in the NFC Divisional Playoffs, San Francisco would have to take on the Dallas Cowboys, "America's Team," who had been to five of the last 11 Super Bowls. They were led by the respected Tom Landry. 

It was a team on the rise against a team that had dominated for so many years. 

With Dallas leading 27-21, Joe Montana would set sail for one of the greatest drives in NFL history that began at the 49ers own 11-yard line. Thirteen plays later it was third down and goal to go for San Francisco. Montana rolled right, backed up, pumped four times and then attempted to throw the ball away. Instead, Dwight Clark jumped into the air and caught the game-winning touchdown. After the extra point, San Francisco would take a 28-27 lead that they took to the locker room. 

San Francisco would go on to win the Super Bowl against Cincinnati, one of the four they won in the decade. Tom Landry and the Dallas Cowboys slipped, and their dynasty way over. 


Seattle Seahawks: Hawks Clip the Panthers for First Super Bowl Appearance
28 of 32
2005 NFC Championship Game: Carolina Panthers at Seattle Seahawks

Seattle couldn't win the AFC Championship after 30 years of existence in that conference, so why not move to the NFC? Well, that didn't turn out too well either. 

Until the 2005 season. Seattle, where some say "football goes to die," was the the epicenter of the NFL world. The Seahawks, after years of futility, finally showed how great of a football city the capital of the Pacific Northwest could be. 

Seattle finished the regular season 13-3, outscoring opponents by an average of 12 points per game. In fact, over a two-game span they outscored the Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers by a combined 81-3 score. This was going to be the team that did what Steve Largent and the like couldn't do, take the 'Hawks to that elusive Super Bowl. 

It was the NFC Championship, with the Carolina Panthers (13-5) visiting the Seattle Seahawks (14-3), a battle of the top  two teams in the conference. After Matt Hasselbeck and Shaun Alexander contributed a score each and the Seahawks nailed a field goal, it was Seattle with a 17-0 second-quarter lead. Carolina came back a few minutes later as Steve Smith took a short punt back 59 yards for a touchdown to get them within two scores. 

With Seattle up 20-7 in the third quarter, the Hawks would put the proverbial nail in the coffin as Hasselbeck connected with Darrell Jackson for a 20-yard touchdown and a few minutes later Shaun Alexander stampeded for a single yard, putting Seattle up 34-7. They would eventually come out ahead by the score of 34-14 and go to the team's first Super Bowl. 


St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams: Greatest Show on Turf Ends 50 Years of Agony

Super Bowl XXXIV: St. Louis Rams vs. Tennessee Titans

Whether it be Roman Gabriel or Eric Dickerson, the St. Louis Rams have had their fair share of super stars. Still, the Rams had never found a Super Bowl to their liking. 

Despite a 32-7 stretch from 1967-1969, the Rams never even made it to a conference title game. From 1983-1986, the Rams made the playoffs each season but won just one playoff game. 

I could continue, but let's get to the greatest show on turf. 

From 1999-2001 the Rams went 37-11 in the regular reason, even besting the three-year dynasty of the Dallas Cowboys just a few seasons before. During that span, Kurt Warner threw for 11,000 yards and nearly 100 touchdowns, people that was three seasons. 

In 1999, the Rams finished the regular season atop the NFC West with a 13-3 record. They outscored their opponents by an average of nearly 18 points per game and scored over 32 points per outing, it was just stupid good. 

Yet, Rams fans couldn't count the dice, they knew the past of this team in Los Angeles. This was the Midwest, however. The Rams would get past both Minnesota and Tampa Bay in the NFC playoffs before matching up with the Tennessee Titans. 

It was a game that matched up the Tennessee Titans (formerly Houston Oilers), who had not won a title since the 1961 AFL Championship over San Diego against the St. Louis Rams (formerly from Los Angeles), who won the NFL title some 50 years before. 

The game itself was well-played as the Rams took a 9-0 lead into the halftime on three Jeff Wilkins field goals. Torry Holt began the second-half scoring by connecting on a nine-yard touchdown pass from Kurt Warner to give the Rams a 16-0 lead. Eddie George scored two consecutive touchdowns to make it 16-13, putting Tennessee was right back in the game. Al Del Greco nailed a 43-yard field goal to tie the game with less than eight minutes remaining in the game. 

However, Kurt Warner and Isaac Bruce would show why it is called the greatest show on turf. They connected on a 73-yard touchdown pass towards the back end of the final quarter to give St. Louis a 23-16 lead. Still, Tennessee had time. Steve McNair drove them down to the Rams' 10-yard line with six second left. McNair dropped back and hit Kevin Dyson at the five-yard line. St. Louis linebacker Mike Jones tackled the Titan wide receiver two feet short of the end zone. 

The Rams had won their first Super Bowl title after two tries. 


Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Battle of the Pirates Leads to a Downed Raider Ship

Super Bowl XXXVII: Oakland Raiders vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers

The year was 2002, and Tampa Bay had not finished below .500 in their last four seasons. Prior to that run this franchise had two double-digit win seasons in 27 years. In fact, Tampa Bay had won a sum total of three playoff games. 

Laughing stock, no longer. Tampa Bay finished the 2002 regular season with a 12-4 record and won the newly-created NFC South division. The Buccaneers would take care of business in the NFC playoffs by outscoring San Francisco and Philadelphia by a combined 58-16 score, and it was on to the Super Bowl. 

That really didn't cause too much of an issue against the Oakland Raiders, who were making a return trip to the big game following a 20-plus year absence. Tampa Bay forced five Raiders turnovers and held Charlie Garner to 10 yards on seven rushes in route to a dominating 48-21 win. 

Finally, Tampa Bay had risen above all other failures and to the top of the football world. 

I would be flung far from the Buc ship if I had not mentioned that former Oakland Raiders coach Jon Gruden coached Tampa Bay to the victory one year after he was traded from Oakland to Tampa Bay. Lovely story!


Tennessee Titans/Houston Oilers: The Cannon Goes off Against San Diego

1960 AFL Championship Game: Los Angeles Chargers vs. Houston Oilers 

It was the Houston Oilers' first year in existence in the American Football League. They had held a chord with the powers to be in the league by saying that football could exist in Houston, while skeptical the Oilers came to be. 

Houston finished 10-4 during their inaugural campaign and to many people's surprise won the Eastern Division. However, the expansion team from Texas, led by under-performing George Blanda, would have to wrestle with the Los Angeles Chargers and Jack Kemp for the league title. 

Billy Cannon and Dave Smith combed for over 1,700 total yards during the season, but the rest of this team was not too impressive. George Blanda threw 22 interceptions and completed less than 50 percent of his passes, and their average margin of victory was less than six points per game. 

Still, Houston found themselves in a situation to win the title with gritty play. Billy Cannon had nearly 180 total yards and scored two touchdowns as Houston defeated Los Angeles 24-6. 

To this day it is the only title either the Houston Oilers or Tennessee Titans have ever won. 


Washington Redskins: Doug Williams Breaks Super Bowl Color Barrier

Super Bowl XXII: Washington Redskins vs. Denver Broncos

Black people weren't supposed to be "smart" enough to play the quarterback position. After all, none had much success (not given a chance). 

So, when Doug Williams led the Washington Redskins to Super Bowl XXII in 1987, Stanford graduate John Elway and the Denver Broncos would wipe the floor with him right? Well, Doug Williams pulled his own Jesse Owens in San Diego. It wasn't Germany, but it still mattered nonetheless. 

Washington went on to kill the Denver Broncos 42-10 by scoring five second-quarter touchdowns, the largest onslaught in NFL history. The Redskins finished with over 600 yards of offense, and Doug Williams was the key. 

He threw for 340 yards and four touchdowns to prove all skeptics wrong. It was the breaking of a color barrier some 40 years to late, but it was amazing nonetheless.

From 1920-1931, the NFL champion was determined by a team's win-loss percentage. In 1932, a playoff game was needed to determine the championship. Starting in 1933, the NFL split into two divisions and a championship game was played between the two division winners. The AFL and NFL announced that the two leagues would merge in 1970. The Super Bowl started to determine the world champions. The game featured the champion of each league. Beginning in 1970, the AFL and NFL played as one league with two conferences, the American Football Conference and the National Football Conference. The two conference champions meet in the Super Bowl to determine the champion.
