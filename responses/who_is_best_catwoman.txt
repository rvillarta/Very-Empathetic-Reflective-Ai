Who was the best catwoman ever?

Use the information below:

Below is list of actresses who played and how they played the role:
--------------------------------------------
Julie Newmar: As the first live-action Catwoman in the 1960s Batman TV series, Julie Newmar set the standard for the character's signature blend of cunning, humor, and a graceful, feline physicality. Her unique, hourglass-shaped costume and her slinking, cat-like movements were as iconic as her seductive banter with Adam West's Batman.

Lee Meriwether: Lee Meriwether took over the role for the 1966 Batman movie when Julie Newmar was unavailable. Her portrayal was unique in that she played a dual role, also posing as the Russian journalist Miss Kitka, which allowed her to show off a more layered and deceptive side of the character. She brought a similar charm and theatricality to the role as Newmar but with a slightly more serious, femme fatale edge.


Eartha Kitt: Eartha Kitt followed as Catwoman in the third season of the 1960s Batman TV series. Her portrayal was campy, playful, and iconic, making the role her own with a distinct sassiness and sultry charm that was very different from her predecessors.

Michelle Pfeiffer: In 1992's Batman Returns, Pfeiffer played a version of Selina Kyle who was a mousy, lonely secretary before a psychotic break transforms her into a seductive and unhinged vigilante. Her performance was praised for its balance of vulnerability and fierce intensity. Her stitched-together, black patent leather suit is one of the most memorable and iconic looks for the character.

Halle Berry: Halle Berry's role in the 2004 Catwoman film was a significant departure from the traditional comic book character. She played a new character named Patience Phillips who gains cat-like abilities after being resurrected by an Egyptian mau cat. This version of Catwoman was a supernatural superheroine, a stark contrast to the human cat burglar of the comics.

Anne Hathaway: In The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Anne Hathaway's Catwoman was a more grounded and realistic take on the character. She was a cynical but cunning cat burglar and con artist motivated by a desire for a fresh start. Her portrayal emphasized her skills as a master thief and her moral ambiguity, and she was never referred to as "Catwoman" in the film.

Zoë Kravitz: Zoë Kravitz's Catwoman in The Batman (2022) was a gritty, street-level character. This version of Selina Kyle was a survivor with a strong sense of justice, deeply tied to the criminal underworld of Gotham. Her character was portrayed as a fighter and a bisexual woman, giving her a modern and nuanced backstory rooted in real-world issues.

Below is a description of catwoman from DC officially:

Catwoman
As deadly as she is beautiful, infamous cat-burglar Selina Kyle uses her nine lives to walk the razor's edge between light and darkness in Gotham City.

The Bat may be the king of the beasts of Gotham. But the Cat? The Cat is definitely the queen. Infamous burglar Selina Kyle is certainly one of the most iconic characters in the DC Universe—not because she's a superhero, per se, but because she's so good at stumping them. Motivated partly by her own self interest, partly by the fun of it all, Catwoman has been baffling Gotham City's heroes, both masked and unmasked, from the very beginning.

An accomplished jewel thief and an occasional hero herself, Selina's murky moral compass has made her relationship with Batman complicated, to say the least. Still, the undeniable magnetism between Bat and Cat is one of Gotham's most reliable constants: wherever Catwoman goes, Batman is sure to follow, if only to take her down. It's a complicated game of cat-and-mouse (cat-and-bat?) that Bruce and Selina have been playing across the streets and rooftops of Gotham for a long, long time.
